## What

 ---   
This program is part of Alura Challenge series from Oracle Next One Education Program. In this app you will find the option to encrypt/decrypt different words and sentences. You can copy the text of the result clicking on the "Copy" button.

You can find this exercise in (https://youtu.be/BLgio_oPkLw)

## Why

---

Alura pushes you to find answers about how JavaScript works. Personally this was the most challenging part of the project. There are some features that can improve:

  -Make it responsive for tablets and phones.
  -When you clear the text in the "write text here" box, the result of the second box also should be cleared.
  -When you write the text in the "write text here" box, the text below the image should be hidden.

  That being said, there will be a future version of this app with the mentioned improvements, but for now, I'll move to learn something that's devouring my soul with curiosity.
